<img src="ChatGPT Image Jan 22, 2026, 07_50_55 PM.png" />

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** learning and practice codes completed across **four trimesters**.  
The goal of this repository is to build a **strong foundation in problem-solving, time complexity analysis, and core data structures** using **C and C++**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand **time & space complexity**
- Learn and implement **fundamental algorithms**
- Practice **data structures from scratch**
- Transition from **procedural programming (C)** to **object-oriented programming (C++)**
- Prepare for **competitive programming, software engineering, and interviews**
