# 📊 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) – 4 Trimester Journey

<img src="Gemini_Generated_Image_v0yrbsv0yrbsv0yr.png" />

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** learning and practice codes completed across **four trimesters**.  
The goal of this repository is to build a **strong foundation in problem-solving, time complexity analysis, and core data structures** using **C and C++**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand **time & space complexity**
- Learn and implement **fundamental algorithms**
- Practice **data structures from scratch**
- Transition from **procedural programming (C)** to **object-oriented programming (C++)**
- Prepare for **competitive programming, software engineering, and interviews**

---
